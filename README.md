# qubit

This project naively emulates qubits and commonly used gates on a classical device.
The goal of this project is to enhance our understanding of the mathematical descriptions of multi-qubit gates.
The final product may be rather inefficient, but our goal is to build towards quantum circuits and algorithms.
